# SANMU static site

This repository contains the static site for SANMU (index.html).

Instructions:
- This repo is ready to be used as a GitHub Pages site. Push to the main branch and enable Pages in repository settings if not already enabled.
- index.html includes references to /_sdk/* scripts; ensure those paths are available on your site or leave them as-is.

If you want me to add a GitHub Actions workflow or change any content, tell me which changes to make.
